# NVIDIA RTX5090 AI Dev Setup

Welcome to the NVIDIA RTX5090 AI Dev Setup repository! 

The jupyter notebook in this repo provides a step-by-step guide for setting up an NVIDIA RTX5090 GPU environment on Ubuntu for AI development. 

You'll learn how to install the latest NVIDIA drivers, set up the CUDA Toolkit, install PyTorch with Blackwell (CUDA 12.8) support, and run a Hugging Face Llama 8B model for inference.

## Overview

This guide covers:
- **Driver Installation:** How to install NVIDIA 5090 drivers on Ubuntu.
- **CUDA Toolkit:** Installing and configuring CUDA 12.8.
- **GPU Verification:** Using `nvidia-smi` to confirm your GPU is correctly recognized.
- **PyTorch Installation:** How to install a nightly build of PyTorch with native Blackwell support.
- **Inference Example:** Running a simple script to verify that PyTorch utilizes your GPU, followed by inference using a Hugging Face Llama 8B model.

Happy coding! Enjoy exploring cutting-edge AI development with NVIDIA RTX5090.
